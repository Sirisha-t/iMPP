## Instructions to run benchmarking on datasets
## All benchmarking scripts can be found in the /benchmark folder and its subfolders

## Please clone the Github repository using the following command
git clone https://github.com/Sirisha-t/iMPP.git

## Go to the directory /iMPP/benchmark
cd iMPP/benchmark

## Command line to run benchmarking on a simulated dataset (sds1 with 2x coverage) is provided below 
## For more details on the test dataset, please refer to Supplementary Methods and Results

## For testing on other datasets benchmarked in the manuscript, please download the reads from: https://cbb.ittc.ku.edu/iMPP.html

## For complete datasets, please use the SRA accession numbers provided in the main manuscript to download the data

## wrapper script (analysis.sh) command line arguments:
    -i input reads (in fastq format)
     -p 0 or 1 (0= single, 1=paired)
     -g fgs/prodigal (type of genecaller)
     -t (comp/ref; comp=complete dataset, without reference. ref=subsampled dataset, with reference)
   
## Run the script analysis.sh with the following command line arguments to benchmark with FGS
## NOTE: Before running the follwing command, please ensure the path/to/scripts are all correctly specified in ~/benchmark/scripts/runFGS_analysis.sh (update to include your local path )

## The test dataset and ground truth reference sequence are provided in the /test folder. You can update the folder to include other datasets (reads and ground truth) to benchmark. 

bash analysis.sh -i test/sds1.2x.fq -p 0 -g fgs -t ref

## Run the script analysis.sh with the following command line arguments to benchmark with Prodigal
## NOTE: Before running the follwing command, please ensure the path/to/scripts are all correctly specified in ~/benchmark/scripts/runMPD_analysis.sh (update to include your local path )
bash analysis.sh -i test/sds1.2x.fq -p 0 -g mpd -t ref
